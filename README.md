# Captive-Portal
This a is a very basic Captive-Portal using an offline authentication service

Built on fresh install of :
- Bootstrap 3.3.6
- Angular 1.2.18

Using only default styling and features. No custom CSS or templates yet

The AuthenticationService has the following methods :
- Login
- RegiterAccount
... but they are both dummy, based on local checks. No API connectivity yet.
